To commit changes from your local repository to GitHub, you typically follow these steps:

1. Initialize Git (if not already initialized)

If you haven't already set up Git in your local project directory, you need to initialize it:


git init
```

2. Stage your changes

Before committing, you need to stage the changes you want to include in the commit. This tells Git which files you want to include in the next commit.

To stage all changes:


git add .

{To stage specific files:
git add file1.txt file2.txt} optional

3. Commit your changes

Once your changes are staged, you commit them with a message that describes the changes you've made:


git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```

4. Link your local repository to GitHub

To link your local repository to a GitHub repository (if it's not already linked), you need to add a remote repository. You can do this with:

git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>
```

Replace `<remote_repository_URL>` with the URL of your GitHub repository. This only needs to be done once per repository.

5. Push your changes to GitHub

Finally, push your committed changes from your local repository to the GitHub repository:


git push -u origin master
```

Here, `-u origin master` sets the upstream branch (where `origin` is the remote repository and `master` is the branch). After setting the upstream branch, you can simply use `git push` in future pushes.

Notes:
- Make sure you have appropriate permissions to push to the GitHub repository.
- If you're working on a branch other than `master`, replace `master` with your branch name in the `git push` command.

By following these steps, your local changes will be committed and pushed to your GitHub repository, making them accessible to others and preserving the history of changes in your project.
