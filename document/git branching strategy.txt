git branching strategy

uber example

to deliver with new changes frequently to customer
master branch : main code
feature branch: if we want to introduce any new changes to existing application. new code written by developers and merge to master branch
release branch: If we are satisfied with the master branch code and don't want to add any new changes to code we create a release branch and deliver to the customer
hotfix branch: very short lived projects, immediate changes will be made, who is having bugs and it is merged back to master/main branch.
